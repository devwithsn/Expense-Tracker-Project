# Expense Tracker (HTML · CSS · JavaScript · localStorage)

A lightweight Expense Tracker web app that demonstrates:
- Adding income/expense transactions
- Category-wise tracking and filtering by month
- Persistent storage using `localStorage`
- Category breakdown chart using Chart.js (CDN)

## Files
- `index.html` — main UI (uses Chart.js from CDN)
- `css/style.css` — styles
- `js/app.js` — app logic and localStorage handling
- `assets/` — placeholder for images (optional)

## Run
Open `index.html` in a modern browser. No server required.

## Notes
- CSV export is provided for quick backup.
- You can extend this to use a backend (Node/Express + DB) for real persistence.
